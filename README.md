# About

OpenGRCT (Open Godot RollerCoaster Tycoon) is an open-source implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon in Godot.

**Note: this project is not meant to be an exact copy/replacement or fully featured RCT game. It's being developed as a means to learn game dev and the Godot game engine. It's also not trying to compete with other RCT projects like [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/). No (RCT or otherwise) copyrighted content is allowed in this project.**

Note 2: if you are looking for a fully working open source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 check out [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/)
